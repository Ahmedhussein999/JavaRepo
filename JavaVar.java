//QUESTION #2

//With our current Allowance, how many battle passes will we be able to buy?
//Comment what you did, and why/how
//QUESTION #1

//the answer will be 2.7 becouse it would be 40.50/15 = 2.7

//What is the total cost of battle passes
//Comment what you did, and why/how
//Add your code to github by committing and pushing!

//the total cost of the battle pass will be 45 because 15x3 = 45
